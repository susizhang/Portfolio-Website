    "Exploration makes my life exciting. I am from China, where I went to university and worked for 5 years before I moved to Germany to live in Bayern in 2021. To learn new skills, knowledge and to explore different places is what I enjoy. I have traveled to more than 15 countries.Currently, I am looking for a full-stack web programming job that can combine using my UX-UI design work experience. 1) When I was working at Unilever China in 2014, I learned about UX-UI as a career and I found it very interesting and fascinating. Then I went to UX-UI classes every day after work. This also led me to a successful job in UX-UI 3 months later, and it lasted until I came to Germany. At that time, I was trying to learn HTML and CSS to work better with programmers, which made me very interested and eager to explore programming. So after I came to Germany, I joined the full-stack web development bootcamp at WBS. Here I learned JavaScript, react, nodejs and other technologies and worked with a team to complete projects, which I really enjoyed. 2) Countries I have traveled or lived in:China, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, Czech Republic, Austria, Switzerland, Canada, Finland, Thailand, Singapore, Australia, Italy, France, Spain",
